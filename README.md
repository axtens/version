# version
A simple versioning system for DOS

VERSION.MOD is based on VERSION.RDY which would have been transpiled into VERSION.BAS before being converted to a TSRBASIC EXE.

VERSION.BAS used VERSION.INI to control language, editor and file extension.

VERSION.MOD used VERSION.SET to do the same thing.

VERSION.VLG is used to log the versioning process which simply looked for a .BAK file and stored it in a RAR file.
